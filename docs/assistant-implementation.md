# Portable assistant implementation ledger

Updated 2026-10-28 (America/Los_Angeles). **Implementation: Verified.** All shared and WordCraft
automated gates passed, and a real local model completed MCP read/edit/read-back/Undo acceptance.
Codex account, hosted-provider and other-platform live acceptance remain separate release gates.
The execution host is **AK's Mini**. **Local preview installation: Deployed**, following the
user's request to place a testable build in `~/Applications`. `/Applications/WordCraft.app` is
unchanged. No public app release or WordCraft push has occurred. After compaction, read this ledger
and inspect Git state; do not restart completed implementation or checks.

## Accepted scope

- A Rust native assistant pane with one conversation and independently selected **General chat**
  and **App control** models. Chat delegates document work to control through WordCraft's existing
  MCP server; unrelated chat does not automatically read the document. Relevant document content
  may reach both selected providers.
- Codex account sign-in through an isolated Craft-managed home, plus OpenAI-compatible hosted/local
  connections. Discover/probe tool capabilities, permit explicit manual model IDs, leave bindings
  unset until configured, and never substitute a provider/model on failure.
- Apply requested edits directly through UI-thread commands, protection checks and normal Undo.
  Bind a turn to its originating document/window/selection; refresh stale document context and
  reject changed selections or unrelated targets. Stop cancels inference and queued edits;
  completed edits remain undoable and uncertain operations are never replayed automatically.
- Permit the current document and files explicitly named/chosen by the user. Enforce exact grants
  at the I/O boundary, including indirect command paths and symlink changes.
- Save per-app chats outside document files with New/Open/Delete and interrupted recovery. Journal
  tool outcomes before dispatch and after acknowledgment. Store credentials in the OS credential
  store; keep them out of settings, transcripts, logs and control responses.
- Reuse `craft-ai-core` connections/models/bindings; put app-independent orchestration, providers,
  persistence and reusable widgets in `craft-libs`. Share suite connections/defaults with per-app
  overrides. Preserve WASM through native-only execution services and existing theme/i18n patterns.
- The user authorized a separate local test build in `~/Applications`: the installed bundle is
  `WordCraft Assistant Preview.app`. Preserve the existing `/Applications/WordCraft.app` and MCP
  wrappers. This authorizes local installation, not a public release.
- **Deferred:** GridCraft/PdfCraft/other app integrations, browser inference and public app release.
  Do not copy existing Codex authentication, chats, settings, skills or MCP registrations.

## Repositories and delivery

| Repository | Checkout / branch | Revision and delivery |
| --- | --- | --- |
| WordCraft | `/Users/andy/Dev/wordcraft`, `codex/portable-assistant` | Base `c4fafc215490a0186ee750454b1ce73a9823daed`; verified implementation and installed binary source `38ca44788a5b190db630059bbbe967c5b6a91f26`. Not pushed; separate local preview installed. |
| craft-libs | `/Users/andy/Dev/craft-libs`, `codex/portable-assistant` | Base `92d392cff132eaf53e13afff77f38b5c11b73aa0`; initial implementation `566be16052de3cbe04fa132a88c24db0b7c7f756`; verified follow-up and final consumer pin **`a8d4c0a178aff4c31d27e05bf87a4e93915bc831`** |

The user explicitly approved publishing to **andykumeda/craft-libs**. Both shared commits were
pushed to that fork's `codex/portable-assistant` branch, and the remote SHA was verified. All
WordCraft craft-libs dependencies and Cargo.lock use the final revision from
`https://github.com/andykumeda/craft-libs`; no sibling-path overrides remain. Original storytold
origins were preserved. Existing non-Craft lockfile package versions remain present.

`plan/` and the local craftrules checkout are absent. `storytold/craftrules` returned 404 through
public and connected reads; no unavailable instructions were invented. Installed Rust/Cargo
1.97.1 and the WASM target were used via `/Users/andy/.cargo/bin`.

## Local preview installation checkpoint

**State: Deployed — local test build, native smoke verified.** The installed native release was
built from `38ca44788a5b190db630059bbbe967c5b6a91f26`, with the shared revision pinned above.
This follow-up adds no application source changes and is not a public release.

| Item | Installed configuration / verification |
| --- | --- |
| Destination | `/Users/andy/Applications/WordCraft Assistant Preview.app`; original `/Applications/WordCraft.app` executable hash unchanged; MCP wrappers preserved |
| Build | Apple Silicon ARM64 release, `cargo build --release --locked -p wordcraft` passed in 6m53s; installed `--version` reports `wordcraft 0.11.0 (38ca4478)` |
| Bundle identity | `ai.storyteller.wordcraft.assistant-preview`; distinct preview display name |
| Signing | Local ad-hoc signing with existing empty entitlements; installed bundle passed `codesign --verify --strict --deep --verbose=2`; no notarization |
| Document profile | Generated bundle environment `WORDCRAFT_PROFILE_DIR=/Users/andy/Library/Application Support/WordCraft Assistant Preview`; persistent preferences/recovery enabled for user testing |
| Assistant settings | Normal launches use the default shared `~/Library/Application Support/Craft/ai`; no credentials, conversations or model bindings copied |
| Codex executable | Generated bundle environment `CRAFT_CODEX_BINARY=/opt/homebrew/bin/codex`; installed version 0.165.0; sign-in/model gates remain open |
| Optional build assets | `CRAFT_I18N_DIR` and `CRAFT_FONTS_DIR` omitted: English UI and existing bundled/system-font defaults; this is not the multilingual distribution build |
| Native smoke | Two LaunchServices launches of the installed bundle using synthetic sample text and disposable assistant settings; Assistant status open/available/idle; screenshot visually inspected; both normal quits succeeded |
| Persistent profile | Second launch used the bundle-defined profile without an override; control key and saved `ui.json` appeared in the preview profile, proving Finder launch environment and preferences persistence |
| Listener cleanup | Temporary control port 17981 had verified app ownership; both smoke instances stopped and released the listener; no permanent listener or startup entry |
| Receipt and screenshot | `/private/tmp/wordcraft-preview-install.json`; `/private/tmp/wordcraft-preview-installed-clean.png` |
| Binary SHA-256 | `a0a824b4c92f9ed308414ab8b27021df5f3c4f21235cc1b6922da29c732ccc6b` |

**Updater caveat:** choose **Later** on the standard WordCraft release update prompt. Updating
this custom preview bundle has not been verified. The smoke selected Later; no update was installed.
No private documents or live inference were used during package verification. The app is installed
and quit, ready for the user to open. The pre-commit `cargo xtask ci` rerun passed all eight stages,
including **4,625 ordinary tests passed / 6 ignored**, the localization audit and 16-crate WASM check.
Output is at `/private/tmp/wordcraft-preview-ci.log`; the release build log is
`/private/tmp/wordcraft-preview-build.log`. This delivery record is committed separately from the
installed source revision; obtain its commit with `git log -1 --format=%H -- docs/assistant-implementation.md`.

## Implementation and review decisions

Shared contracts extend existing ai-core types without changing job behavior. `run_turn` uses
`ChatProvider` and `ToolHost`, with no WordCraft document dependency. Its synchronous
`TurnEvent::Checkpoint` journaling precedes dispatch and follows results; persistence failure
cancels queued work. Interrupted history closes unresolved calls explicitly and never replays
edits. Tool batches and saved message pairing are validated; schemas count toward context limits;
credential redaction covers streaming fragments, catalogs, tool arguments and error paths.

The Codex adapter uses an isolated home and ephemeral threads with bounded Craft history. A
synthetic external `.agents` skill proved that CODEX_HOME alone did not isolate discovery;
HOME and USERPROFILE now point at the Craft home too. Effective-policy, OS denial and selected-model
callback/continuation checks must pass before caller context. No persisted bypass exists.

WordCraft's `assistant/host.rs` bridges the existing MCP server to UI dispatch, checks document,
window, revision and full selection, enforces exact-file grants including indirect reads, and
refuses app/global settings and implicit dialogs. Authorized Open deliberately rebinds and
requires reading the new target. Missing acknowledgments are uncertain and never retried.
`assistant/native.rs` owns background jobs, provider dispatch, checkpoints, local history and
credential transactions. Failed key replacement preserves the old key; removal deletes only
unreferenced secrets. Ordinary headless WordApp instances never load the user's assistant profile.

Review fixes cover settings reload/Stop, saved connection identity, unsent drafts, stale route
labels, nested tool IDs, named-path tokenization, symlink retargeting, same-document other-window
edits, clipboard expansions and keyboard command search. The Thai font regression now tests real
tone-mark stacking instead of requiring OpenType tables on macOS's AAT-based Thonburi; no product
font behavior changed and no test was skipped to pass CI.

## Verification evidence

| Check | Actual result | Log / artifact |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Shared final source | fmt, all-target workspace Clippy, unfiltered tests **1,831 passed / 28 ignored**, core/UI WASM passed | `/private/tmp/craft-assistant-home-{fmt,shared-clippy,shared-tests,wasm}.log` |
| Shared native boundaries | Two synthetic app catalogs, routing/no-fallback, fragmented streams, malformed calls, duplicate prevention, limits/redaction, concurrent stores/recovery passed | Shared ledger and native test suites |
| WordCraft final CI | All 8 stages passed: fmt, Clippy, tests, i18n-report, doctest, assets, layers, WASM; **4,625 ordinary tests passed / 6 ignored**, no failures | `/private/tmp/wordcraft-assistant-ci-verified.log` |
| Focused assistant / file access | Initial assistant **31 passed / 1 ignored**, engine file access **11 passed**; later regressions included in final CI | `/private/tmp/wordcraft-assistant-final-tests.log`, `/private/tmp/wordcraft-assistant-files-tests.log` |
| Native pane screenshot | Passed and visually inspected; synthetic transcript/roles/tool activity/composer; no profile or Keychain access | `/private/tmp/wordcraft-assistant-screenshot.log`; `/var/folders/cg/796c5bys74db15ww0b_qvw8c0000gn/T/wordcraft-assistant-pane.png` |
| macOS Codex sandbox | Installed Codex 0.165 read/write/network denial and isolated home discovery passed with synthetic files; no account inference | `/private/tmp/craft-assistant-home-live.log`; shared native services doc |
| macOS Keychain | New synthetic item write/read/delete passed; no existing credential inspected | Shared `docs/assistant-native-services.md` |
| Local live model | **Passed in 359.61s**: both roles, original read, exact requested edit/read-back, persisted checkpoints and one normal Undo; 8 calls started/finished | `/private/tmp/wordcraft-assistant-live-ollama-final.log` |
| Preview delivery | ARM64 release build, installed version/hash/signature, native Assistant/profile smoke and original app preservation passed; full CI rerun passed all 8 stages | `/private/tmp/wordcraft-preview-{build,ci}.log`; install receipt and screenshot above |

Live acceptance used the explicit isolated `CRAFT_AI_CONFIG_DIR=/private/tmp/wordcraft-assistant-live-ollama`,
Ollama at `http://127.0.0.1:11434/v1`, and existing `gemma4:e4b` for both roles. No models were
downloaded, no credentials supplied, and application bindings remain unset. The model first
attempted edits before reading; the host refused them. It then read, delegated again, edited and
verified successfully. Completed turns are not proof that every future model response will comply.

The first local attempt failed with Provider after 219.96s (log `wordcraft-assistant-live-ollama.log`).
The second completed but exposed a test observer that recognized only top-level get_text, not
valid execute/batch reads (log `wordcraft-assistant-live-ollama-diagnostic.log`). The corrected
observer verifies exact successful MCP read results, rejects summary/mutation echoes, and has a
passing regression. The final fresh turn passed; no conversation or uncertain edit was replayed.

To repeat with explicitly prepared provider settings, run the ignored test
`assistant::native::tests::live_configured_models_edit_read_back_and_undo_through_mcp` with an
absolute CRAFT_AI_CONFIG_DIR containing connections.json and runtime.json. It probes each distinct
selected model, uses synthetic text and disposable history, and never signs in automatically.
For consistent workspace feature unification, use `cargo test --workspace --lib --bins --tests
assistant::native::tests::live_configured_models_edit_read_back_and_undo_through_mcp -- --ignored --exact --nocapture`.

## Remaining release gates and cleanup

- Complete Craft-managed Codex sign-in and actual selected-model callback/continuation, WordCraft
  end-to-end and adversarial containment acceptance. The adapter remains fail-closed on any gate
  failure. The actual local sandbox probe is not account/model acceptance.
- Configure a hosted compatible endpoint and verify live routing, including mixed Codex/API roles.
  No existing account chats, API keys or private document content were accessed for development.
- Verify Windows/Linux/BSD credential stores and native keyboard/accessibility/window behavior;
  complete native-speaker translation review. Missing translations use existing catalog fallback.
- User testing can proceed in the installed separate preview. Choose Later on standard-release
  update prompts. Public app release remains deferred; do not replace `/Applications/WordCraft.app`
  or change its MCP wrappers as part of this preview.
- Task-owned test/release/CI caches and the temporary package staging directory were removed after
  checks. The installed preview is retained for user testing. Useful logs, screenshots, installation
  receipts and credential-free synthetic live settings remain under Temp. The task-owned Ollama process exited successfully;
  a fresh socket check confirmed port 11434 released. Its stopped state is recorded in
  `~/.codex/LOCAL_SERVICES.md` (outside Git, so not committable here). Both preview smoke listeners
  on port 17981 also stopped; their launch/cleanup evidence is recorded in that inventory. No proxy
  or persistent startup entry was added.

No global memory update was requested or performed. This is the durable repository ledger;
the shared repository ledger owns shared implementation details and verification.
